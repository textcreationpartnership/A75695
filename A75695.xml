            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have withheld this return too long; of which I am by ſo much the more aſhamed, by how much I found yours ſo full of kindneſſe: I will pretend to no excuſe; but if your good nature will ſuggeſt, that the deep ſenſe of my afflictions doth ſo oppreſſe my ſpirits, as it renders me altogether indiſpoſed to the leaſt intercourſe, you will be charitable, and take me right.</p>
            <p>Would you beleeve, that to my ſorrows for the ſufferings of our deer Maſter the King, and the danger of the Publick, the generality of men in this Kingdom (and probably in many other parts too) ſhould charge mee with the ſcandal of having betrayed His Majeſtie into the Iſle of Wight, and that by compact with the Parliament and Army, before his departure from <hi>Hampton Court?</hi> And to obtain belief the better, have digeſted that their calumny into this form; That I did conſpire with them to affright His Majeſtie away from thence, that they might have the better opportunity (being at a greater diſtance from <hi>London</hi>) to deſtroy him; which to effect, the neerneſſe of that place made it very difficult, if not impoſſible: and that my reward for this ſervice hath been a great ſum of money? Thus from ſeverall hands.</p>
            <p>Which reproach, though I never deſerved, and take my ſelf to be very much above any thing of that kinde; yet ſince there is no perſon ambitious to acquire or preſerve an honeſt reputation, but is awake, and alwayes carryes about him a tenderneſſe to the leaſt prejudice or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161497:3"/> diminution thereof; I cannot but be touched with ſome ſenſe of that unhappy report, and give you (in whoſe good eſteem I am much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) the true ſtate of my part in that action, ſo far as may enable you to ſatisfie (if you meet with him) the moſt malicious perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
            <p>That I was commanded by their Majeſties and the Prince his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to return into <hi>England,</hi> with Inſtructions to endeavour by the beſt means imaginable, ſuch a compliance between His Majeſty and the Army, as might have influence, and beget a right underſtanding between His Majeſtie and the Parliament, is a truth well known. That my infirmities are ſo great, and ſo publick, as that it had been better for their-ſervice to have given that imployment to ſome other of more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent endowments, I do acknowledge with great humility: But that I did fulfill that Truſt with all induſtry and fidelity to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, I appeal to God and them, and do not doubt but I have my portion of favour, and ſtand ſtill numbred in the Catalogue of thoſe Subjects whom they are yet pleaſed to ſtile faithfull.</p>
            <p>What paſſed between mee and any Member either of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Army, as it will not at all advantage His Majeſties affairs to relate; ſo will it not any way conduce to my vindication. This word I ſhall only let ſall, That a wiſer man then I, or whoever is my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cenſurer, would and ought to have given credit to them, when power and intereſt accompanied with large expreſſions of good will, were the arguments and motives to gain beleef of their reall intentions. Nay truly, though His Majeſtie had known they intended nothing leſſe then the performance of thoſe duties to their Soveraigne and Country, I cannot finde (I know not what a quicker-ſighted man might have done) how in prudence his Majeſtie could have purſued any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or made any other application then what he did, conſidering the power under which hee was: Which ſhall ſerve by way of glance at my part of negotiation in generall, becauſe even therein likewiſe I am not without ſome prejudice in many mens conceptions.</p>
            <p>Some few weeks before his Majeſties remove from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> there was ſcarce a day in which ſeverall alarms were not brought to his Majeſtie, by, and from very conſiderable perſons (both well affected to him, and likely to know much of what was then in agitation) of the reſolution which a violent party in the Army had to take away his life: and that ſuch a deſigne there was, there were ſtrong
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161497:3"/> inducements to perſwade; and I hope charity will be afforded to thoſe many who were and ſtill are of that belief, ſince I confeſſe my ſelf to be of that number. Which practice ſeemed to his Majeſty the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for that many other particulars which were ſaid in thoſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to precede that action, fell out accordingly; whereupon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie thought it not wiſdome longer to deſpiſe the poſſible means left him for the prevention of that danger, and therefore reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himſelf from thence, but with this poſitive intention, not to deſert this Kingdom, either by croſſing the Seas, or going into <hi>Scotland.</hi> The reaſons his Majeſtie gave, you will pardon me if I deliver not, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend your Cenſure, in caſe your judgement invite you to oppoſe that reſult, till you hear the weight of them, and I will ingage the little credit the world hath left me, you ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>And what man is hee, who hath the leaſt grain of underſtanding, bears about him any affections either to his ſacred Perſon, or to the Common good, hath any regard to his own duty or reputation, would have taken upon him to diſſwade his Majeſtie from what he had then reſolved on, and thereby expoſed himſelf both to the danger and guilt of that miſchief, which ſo many had forewarned him of, and was ſo likely to happen? Sure I am, if I had been that man, I ſhould have thought my ſelf juſtly to have merited the Character of unfaithfulneſſe, which is now ſo injuriouſly caſt upon me.</p>
            <p>It reſted then that his Majeſtie was to make choice of a place, where he might avoid the preſent danger, where he might give leaſt offence to the intereſt of the Parliament and Army, where he might have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intercourſe with both, for ſetling a Peace (of which he then deſpaired not;) and laſtly, where he might moſt ſecurely (and the meaſure of ſafety was, where there were no Souldiers) expect the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the ruinous power of the Levellers and their faction, to be the fruits of the General Rendezvous, which was immediately to follow.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds, his Majeſtie thought the Iſle of Wight moſt proper for his reſidence, eſpecially if he could obtain honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from the Governour of that place; to whom (when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie was come within twenty miles) he commanded Sir <hi>John Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and my ſelf to repair, and make trial of what Reception we could procure for him; who, after ſome conſideration of what we propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, proffered this Engagement, [That <hi>ſince it appeared his Majestie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161497:4"/> came from Hampton-Court to ſave his life, if he pleaſed to put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te his hands, whatever he could expect from a perſon of honour or honeſty, his Majeſtie ſhould have it made good by him:</hi>] which truely to us ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient; and I do for my own part acknowledge, my confidence was, that, by that Engagement, he would not have laid any reſtraint upon his Majeſtie, nor have given acceſſe to any Souldiers into that Iſland: But how honourably and how faithfully he hath performed his promiſed duty to the King, you are as good a witneſſe as my ſelf; and therefore, as I take little pleaſure in the memory of it, ſo there will be little ſatisfaction to you in the repeating it: it ſhall ſuffice that I have now been taught, that Honour and Honeſty have clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary definitions in ſeveral mens underſtandings.</p>
            <p>For the election his Majeſtie made of the Iſle of Wight, upon the grounds before mentioned, as therewith I did then concur, ſo (with reſpect to their judgements who are otherwiſe perſwaded) I do ſtill believe it was (as his affairs then ſtood) the beſt of any place which he could make choice of: And I will not be afraid to avow my opinion, becauſe ſucceſſe hath made it ſeem leſſe reaſonable; which being taken out of the Scale, and all circumſtances worthy debate before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Hampton-Court, conſidered; perhaps wiſer men then choſe, who in that preſume to condemn his Majeſties judgement, may yet approve of that choice. However, his Majeſtie was reſolved to go from Hampton-Court; and, I know not what other mens cuſtoms are, I cannot but be well ſatisfied with my own, which hath been ever ready to ſubmit, when his Majeſtie hath been willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and I ſhould account it a great misfortune to me, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhould be ſuch, to which I ſhould think fit rather with humility to oppoſe my reaſons, then with cheerfulneſs to obey his pleaſure; but that ſtraight hath never yet happened, nor (I am confident) ever will: ſo careful is his Majeſtie to impoſe nothing upon any man, but what he believes juſt and lawful.</p>
            <p>That any Member of the Parliament or Army had any knowledge by me of his Majeſties removal from Hampton-Court, or that any Compact between me and any of them was ever made, to the diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Majeſtie in any particular whatſoever, I provoke them and all the world to produce the leaſt colour of proof, and deſire that no man would ſpare me more then I ſhould do ſuch whom I found guilty of ſo baſe a crime; and ſhall not ſtick to invite them to it, who have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161497:4"/> been ſo liberal in blaſting my reputation, when I may live with that freedom they do, which either their greater wiſdom, or their leſſe loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty then mine, hath purchaſed. In the mean time, it is ſome comfort to me to finde theſe cenſurers to be men but of ſuch diſpoſitions, as will hazard no more then onely their good wiſhes for his Majeſtie; and for ſuch I take them, and for ſuch leave them.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould tell theſe ſevere judges of other mens actions, that his Majeſties preſent perſonal condition is the ſame in the Iſle of Wight, with what it was when he left Hampton-Court, they would perhaps wonder at me, but upon examination finde it truth: for before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties coming from thence (at leaſt ſix days) he was forbidden riding abroad, and confined within the limits of that place.</p>
            <p>And if any man can aſſure me, that if his Majeſtie had continued at Hampton-Court, the Parliament would not have preſented theſe four Bills to him, or that they being preſented, his Majeſties refuſing to make them Laws, ſhould not have drawn on his late reſtraint, or the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Votes of Parliament concerning farther application to his Majeſtie, I ſhall then (for indeed I take that to be the cauſe of his relapſe) with great lowlineſſe of ſpirit acknowledge my ſelf to have been an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie (though not an unfaithful) inſtrument in his Majeſties remove from Hampton-Court: But till then, my ſufferings in theſe ſcandals may be continued, but my opinion not changed, nor the quietneſſe of my minde diſturbed, for having in that action diſcharged my duty to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.</p>
            <p>As for the money I ſhould have received for betraying his Majeſtie, if none of my Calumniators have more to ſubſiſt on, then I have had either from Parliament or Army, they would be in worſe condition, then (notwithſtanding all their malice to me) I wiſh them. In ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, it would better have become thoſe who firſt deſigned me this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, to have made choice of ſome, who had a mark upon them for doing ſome action, which may at leaſt be of kin to the accuſation, though but between fellow-ſubjects: but you will pardon my vanity, if I ſay I abhor ſuch unworthineſſe, and defie mankinde to bring the leaſt blemiſh of that nature in judgement againſt me.</p>
            <p>I have done, when I have told you, that I have heard Divines ſay, that God doth moſt puniſh us in thoſe things we moſt prize, and think our ſelves moſt concerned: I ſhall therefore hope to make a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe of theſe aſperſions caſt upon my integrity: for I fear I did
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161497:5"/> glory too much in my honour of faithfulneſſe and loyalty to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and did not thankfully conſider (as I ought to have done) that it was the bleſſing of God which enabled me to go thorow with the performance of my duty in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>If men would but as well think upon the ſolicitude and care of their mindes, who are honoured with neer relations to the ſervice of great Princes, as they look upon the advantages which thereby Fortune may caſt upon them, they would finde more cauſe to pity them for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and hazards (which is ordinarily beyond their capacities to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, who are at very remote diſtance) then to envie them for their honour or profit. But ſince of all evils ſeated in the heart of man, Malice hath the greateſt dominion, it were vain for Vertue it ſelf to hope for freedom from thoſe effects which naturally ariſe from it; and much more for me, who though in this particular have as much innocence to protect me, as can be conſiſtent with mortality, yet in other things which may be imputed to weakneſs, and unskilfulneſs in matters of great concernment, I do with all ingenuity confeſſe, no man carries a greater weight of guilt then he whoſe care it is, to preſerve unſpotted the reputation of an honeſt man, thereby to retain ſtill the favour and affection, wherewith you have conſtantly honoured,</p>
